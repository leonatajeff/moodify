# moodify
We are developing a web app inspired by https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/ in GAE and Flask for CS1520. 

## ⛷ Run the backend
For our development phase, you must add your client id and secret from the spotify dashboard for the API to work. We do not have dynamic login yet.

```bash
$ cd api
$ python3 setup.py install
$ flask run
```

## ⛷ Run the frontend

```bash
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
